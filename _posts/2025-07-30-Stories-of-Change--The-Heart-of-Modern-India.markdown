His empathy was unexpected; he offered not just comforting words but also practical advice based on his own experiences. This young man, a B.Com graduate, had dreams of pursuing an MBA through distant learning while running his shop. 
His story resonated with me, illustrating that kindness and ambition often thrive side by side. In a society where education is increasingly valued, encounters like these serve as reminders that compassion can emerge from the most unlikely places.
